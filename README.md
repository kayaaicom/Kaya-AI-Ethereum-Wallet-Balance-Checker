# Kaya AI Ethereum Wallet Balance Checker
Kaya AI Ethereum Wallet Balance Checker is an application that checks the balances of Ethereum wallets on the Ethereum network. This tool allows users to query the balances of specified Ethereum wallet addresses. All you need is a list of wallet addresse

First of all, we provide our infrastructure from go ethereum. We need to create a node to start the application, do not forget to follow the steps below.

Download GETH:
https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads

Then you need to run it on the localhost and port I defined in the script. For this reason, after you have finished installing geth, i.e. go ethereum, open the command prompt and enter the following code in the command line.

`geth --http --http.addr "localhost" --http.port 8545`

"This will allow you to create a node on the specified port on localhost."

And bingo! You can run the app and check the addresses. Thanks to me you don't need to use API... :)

## **Usage:**

Requirements for using the project:

First, create a address.txt file that contains the wallet addresses. Each wallet address in this file should be on a separate line. Then run the KayaAI.exe file. The application begins to check the balances of the specified wallet addresses. Wallets with balance are recorded in a file named complete.txt. Note: Both the address.txt file and the KayaAI.exe file must be in the same location.

## **Description:**
This tool connects to an Ethereum node to check the balances of the specified wallet addresses. It makes an API call to the node for each wallet address, and the result is recorded in the complete.txt file.

In addition, the application displays the wallet addresses being checked and any possible errors on the screen to inform the user and make the experience more user-friendly.

### **Disclaimer:**
As the developer of this tool, I do not accept any responsibility for its illegal use. This tool is designed for the user to check the balance of their own wallets or for other legally permitted purposes.
